<p><b>aiconic</b></p>
<p>aiconic is an artificial intelligence research lab and engineering company. We believe that every decision that can be data driven should be data driven. We believe machine learning is the technology to extract the truth from your data.</p>

<p><b>What we build</b></p>
<p>At aiconic we build end-to-end systems for top tier companies that create million dollar impacts. This includes data pipelines and database infrastructure, development of state of the art machine learning systems and real time prediction APIs.</p>

<p><b>Who we are</b></p>
<p>Our team graduated from and worked at the leading universities in the world, such as NYU, Berkeley, TU Delft, University of Amsterdam and the RWTH Aachen. We publish at the top machine learning conferences like ICML and UAI. All of us turned down major offers from the top tier tech companies and quantitative hedge funds of this world. Because we don't want to be tiny blobs in a tech corporation. Because we want to steer the narrative ourselves.</p>

<p><b>Hiring</b></p>
<p>Weâ€™re not making it easy. If you can get hired here, you can probably get hired anywhere. So why join? Because you feel the same. You believe that machine learning will impact almost every industry but you don't want to be a blob. You want to steer that narrative yourself. You want to work with the smartest and most driven people in a small elite team. You want hard problems thrown at you every single day and then relentlessly execute to solve them. You like to win and you have a steady moral compass.</p>
