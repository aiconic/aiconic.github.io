<p><b>Aiconic</b></p>
<p>Aiconic is an artificial intelligence research lab and engineering company. We believe that every decision can be enhanced by a data-driven approach, and that machine learning is the technology to extract the most valuable insights from data.</p>

<p><b>What we build</b></p>
<p>At Aiconic we build end-to-end systems for top tier companies that create million dollar impacts. This includes data pipelines and database infrastructure, development of state-of-the-art machine learning systems, and real-time prediction APIs.</p>

<p><b>What we research</b></p>
<p>We are strongly interested in fundamental research, primarily focussed on unsupervised learning. Additionally we enjoy exploring how the latest results in academia can be effectively utilized to solve real world problems.</p>

<p><b>Who we are</b></p>
<p>Our team graduated from, and worked at the leading universities in the world, such as NYU, Berkeley, TU Delft, University of Amsterdam and the RWTH Aachen. We publish at top machine learning conferences like ICML, AISTATS, NIPS, and UAI. All of us turned down offers from the top tier tech companies and quantitative hedge funds of this world, because we don't want to be tiny blobs in a tech corporation, but prefer to steer the narrative ourselves.</p>
